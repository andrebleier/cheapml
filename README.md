===================================


This repo contains machine learning algorithms coded from scratch. These implementations are not designed for high-performance, the focus lies on coding a generic implementation only with necessary code. 

There will be two blog posts about the code and the machine learning algorithms as whole.
You can find the gradient boosting one [here](https://www.statworx.com/blog/coding-gradient-boosted-machines-in-100-lines-of-code) and
the one about regression trees [here](https://www.statworx.com/blog/coding-regression-trees-in-150-lines-of-code).

Cheers
